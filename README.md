# RISCV-OISC

Master Thesis at Institute of Complex Systems @JKU Linz. This work takes the RISCV RV32I Base Integer Instructions and replaces every instruction (with some exceptions like e.g. load/store) with sub and blt such that the resulting program has the same architectural states (same register values) as the original one.
